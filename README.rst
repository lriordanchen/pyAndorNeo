Andor Neo drivers in Python using SDK3

**Note** This code wasn't fast enough for my needs in 2015 (I need 100+ fps, and this code was good for 5-10 fps), so I moved on to [C++ with Andor SDK3](https://github.com/scivision/Andor-sCMOS-examples).  
You might try the Bitbucket code above, which is regularly updated, and from whence this Python code came from.
